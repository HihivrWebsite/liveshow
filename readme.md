## Installation

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HihivrWebsite/liveshow.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask requests
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start the Flask application:

```bash
python user_info.py
```

The application will start running on `http://localhost:31368` by default. You can access the web interface and API endpoints from there.
